We can just return a constant node here because the abstraction mechanism will have already lifted the circuit into

This rewrite adds abstractions to the definition, which provide patterns to
extract parts of the graph.  The `type` given to each extracted node has to
match the `type` of the node in LHS and RHS graphs.
